## 🎬 Demo Strategy

### **Opening (15 seconds):**
> "EdgeNudge uses AMD-accelerated edge AI to save $20K/year across 100 campus rooms while avoiding 74 tons of CO₂. Watch this."

### **Live Demo (60 seconds):**
1. **Click "🎬 Auto Demo"** - Single room cycles through 4 scenarios
2. **Click "🚀 Start Campus Simulation"** - 10 rooms monitored live
3. **Show feature importance** - Explain PIR/Phone are key sensors
4. **Highlight AMD section** - Point out ROCm roadmap

### **Technical Proof (30 seconds):**
- Show <50ms inference in metrics
- Show 1.36 KB model size
- Open DevTools → Zero network requests (privacy)
- Point to edge vs cloud comparison

### **Impact (15 seconds):**
> "100 rooms = $20K saved, 74 tons CO₂ avoided. Pilot-ready today. And unlike cloud ML, we eliminate 2 tons of data center emissions too."
